# Workout Tracking Features

## Overview
This milestone implements the core value proposition of GymGenius: tracking workouts. We will implement strict data models, backend services, and frontend hooks for managing workout sessions.

## Features
- **Data Models:** Zod schemas for `Workout`, `Exercise`, `ExerciseSet`
- **Firestore Service:** Create, update, complete workouts
- **React Hooks:** `useActiveWorkout`, `useWorkoutHistory` (TanStack Query)

## Verification
- Automated tests for schemas and service logic
- Manual verification of real-time sync
